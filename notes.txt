NOTES ON BATTLES
[ ] a character can battle any other character
   [ ] the user-operated character's stats will be affected
   [ ] the opponent's stats will not be affected
   [ ] the level of the opponent will determine how many points the UO character earns
      [ ] the closer they are to the same level, the more points earned.
      [ ] battling a character far below your level will not earn many points
      [ ] at a certain point it will earn 0 for battling someone far below you
      [ ] battling a character of a higher level grants a bonus
[x] BATTLE CLASS Fields:
  [x] protag_id, foreign_key: user_id (CHECK DOCUMENTATION FOR ESTABLISHING THESE)
  [x] antag_id, foreign_key: user_id (CHECK DOCUMENTATION FOR ESTABLISHING THESE)
  [x] outcome ("Victory" or "Defeat" from the perspective of protagonist)
  [x] points (negative if defeated, positive if victorious - determined at end of battle)
  [x] turn_count (updated every turn)
  [x] log (keeps a transcript of all moves + snapshot of players' health)
[x] CHARACTER CLASS Additional Fields:

  [x] level_progress - current points earned in progress to level (starts at 0)

  [x] defeats - (starts at 0)
[ ] CHARACTER CLASS Changes

      [x] add warning on new char form
   [ ] stats on Char show page should reflect level adjustment

Who can battle?
  - must have some superpowers selected
  - cannot have another battle in progress

(MAYBE IMPLEMENT THIS IN THE FUTURE users have the option to turn off battles (no one can battle you) - or requires a request and then your stats will be affected?)
